Implemented type_list.

Implemented the following functionality:
	type_at				- type of the given position
	length				- length of the type_list
	index_of			- index of the given type
	append				- appends new type_list or new types to the type_list
	erase				- erases the given type from the type_list, only the first one
	erase_all			- erases the given type from the type_list, all
	remove_duplicates	- removes all duplicate types
	replace				- replace the given type with another, only the first one
	replace_all			- replace the given type with another, all
	
All operations are done in compile time.
Also implemented print function.

Note: all wrong usages will lead to compile error, not linkage error.
